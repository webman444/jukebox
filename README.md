# Hello!

I'm Samuel, and I'm **pretty new to Github**, so expectedly, I struggled in trying to upload this
code online. I actually spent near an hour to even realize my repositories are different. I hope 
you will appreciate this unfinished website of mine. Thank you!

# Welcome to Jukebox!

Jukebox is a website where you can discover your own music taste by typing a three-digit code
to play a song correlated to that code! (The point of this website is that **you don't know what will
show up until you press Enter.**)
 
# Help!

The reason I put this website here in the first place is because **I need your help finishing it!** You see, 
I only have about 30 songs on here, and i need **999!** (designated with codes 001-999) You can submit 
suggestions on what song to place in the website [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9p7y0z88382GU71aSNjH5WttpQM2jGFyM8wemxj8aIeMEJQ/viewform?usp=dialog)!

**Thank you!**
**(Also plz donate to @mayorflappy on Paypal)***(I need money to buy a web domain and web hosting services)*
